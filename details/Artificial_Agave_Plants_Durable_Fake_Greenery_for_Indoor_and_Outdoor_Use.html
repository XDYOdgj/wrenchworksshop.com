I love the look ofartificial agave plants and after getting some huge green ones I got these medium reds to go with. They are a decent medium size and as shown in my photos can be opened up wide or kept in for more depth. The color can also be seen in my photos, it\u2019s very beautiful and looks realistic how it changes with the sunlight. They are very natural looking and extremely durable. The stems are about two inches thick and plenty long for planting directly into the ground or a big planter if you prefer. For my photos I have these sitting in my 30 inch planter for size reference. At the time of purchase these were about forty dollars for the set and they\u2019re definitely worth it.","purchase_model":"Color: Purple and Red Color: Purple and Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-27 16:10:09"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"My order took a while to arrive - but it was worth the wait.These TWO faux Agave plants are quite lifelike.They are large, substantial in thickness and design of the leaves, and authentically sized.They arrive on a thick, heavy 'stem' that can be pressed into soil or gravel in a planter for a very realistic appearance.","purchase_model":"Color: Purple and Red Color: Purple and Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-23 16:10:09"},{"user":"AML","content":"Faux AgaveThese faux plants are big and look like a live plant.They are mostly green, with the tips being a burgundy color.
