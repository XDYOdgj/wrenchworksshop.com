Full sun with 100+ temps in summer make it difficult to keep real plants alive on my porch (not to mention I do tend to forget to water lol!) this solves it all. Fluffing the branches is key to give it a full look after unboxing. Although itâ€™s not quite as full to the top as the advertised pics, I still love the look! It shipped & arrived quickly & was packaged well. I highly recommend these tress!",

They are absolutely stunning and look incredibly lifelike. I\u2019ve had them for about a month now, and they\u2019ve completely transformed my front yard landscaping.What impressed me the most is how well they\u2019ve held up against the weather. Rain, wind, and even a little frost haven\u2019t affected their appearance at all\u2014they still look as vibrant and fresh as the day I unpacked them. The craftsmanship is excellent, with no loose branches or fading, and they truly require zero maintenance.I also love how versatile they are. They work beautifully in my outdoor planters, but I can easily see them being used indoors as well. The size is perfect\u2014not too overwhelming but just tall enough to make an elegant statement.If you're looking for durable, realistic-looking greenery to enhance your space, these are a fantastic choice. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-17 16:10:10"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"Purchased two of these topiary trees for our front door at the holidays. I added outdoor fairy lights which made them pop! Impressed with the quality and real-look and feel of these trees. A few minor pieces fell off when I first fluffed the trees but easily reattached (wouldn't have been missed regardless). I found the trees to be the perfect size and sufficiently full. My only suggestion is to add rocks or something to weight them down if they will be subjected to decent winds. Overall VERY happy with my purchase & would recommend :)","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-06 16:10:10"},{"user":"Janet E.

I highly recommend them. We have these tall planters and I always struggled with what to put in them for each season without spending too much to constantly replace live plants. These look great on my porch and they are high quality. Only one of the small green branches can off as I was fluffing the trees. They were really easy to put together after taking them out of the boxes and the bottom is heavy and not made of cheap plastic. I also didn't feel there was a bad smell to these like other reviews mentioned.

So no big deal.They are in sturdy pots with cement.I placed them in ceramic pots.They\u2019ve never blown over.I positioned the pots under arches, at the edge of the walkway in front of our house.Everyone thinks they are real, I don\u2019t have to water them & the summer heat will not kill them!!Great value.

After much deliberation, I decided to order 6 of these trees to put in the planters. The packaging, ease of assembly and fluffing up was great. With the addition of ribbons and solar lights, they were perfect for our needs and there are still people who are surprised that these trees are not real. They were \u2018planted\u2019 in November and after countless snow and ice storms, they have held up beautifully - a true testament to the quality of these trees?","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-07 16:10:10"},{"user":"Blair","content":"These Yemmen 2 Pack 5 foot Cedar Artificial Trees are very real looking and the shape can be customized to appear shaggy or streamlined depending on how the branches are positioned.In the photo on the left I have started to customize the shape of each branch by bending the main branch at the trunk and then the smaller branches off of each main branch.You can spend a fair amount of time fluffing each branch and checking the appearance of the tree from all angles.The fluffing of these trees is similar to fluffing a Christmas tree.Bending the tips upward create a more full look and when a tree is fluffed up the branches are separated, spread out, and gently bent to create a fuller, more natural look.If the branches remain tight to the tree trunk such as how the trees appear after unpacking the shape is very streamlined and has a triangular shape, wide at the base and the branches become narrower to the top of the tree.The second image was unpacked and the branches not fluffed.If the branches are fluffed out and bent a shaggy appearance can be obtained similar to the product images in the product description on Amazon.I was pleasantly surprised that the trees look so real.The light green on the edges looks just like our real Cedar trees except these artificial trees won\u2019t be deer food this winter.This will be our first winter with the trees outside at up to 30 below zero in January/February.I will update my review in the spring after our harsh temperatures this winter.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-25 16:10:10"},{"user":"Melmo","content":"Just what I was looking for to add some greenery without live plant upkeep! Full sun with 100+ temps in summer make it difficult to keep real plants alive on my porch (not to mention I do tend to forget to water lol!) this solves it all. Fluffing the branches is key to give it a full look after unboxing. Although it\u2019s not quite as full to the top as the advertised pics, I still love the look!
