I have had my shrubs outside for about a month now, and they still look great after the sun, wind, and storms.They are tough plants.They adjust wonderfully.Once they are bent, they stay that way.No cons, they really worked out great for me, and I am very happy with the purchase.","purchase_model":"Size: 22in Size: 22in  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-22 16:10:10"},{"user":"Toy Clouds","content":"Upon opening, these need help, but once you work on them, adjusting each branch and fluffing them all out they look very realistic. I\u2019m glad there is color variation from dark green to light, this makes the shrubs look much more natural.I planted them in potting soil in 2 large pedestal urns with some real ivy and you cannot tell they are artificial.I would not hesitate to use these in landscaping beds with real flowers or other shrubs.","purchase_model":"Size: 18in Size: 18in  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-23 16:10:10"},{"user":"Jessica G.","content":"The \"plant\" portion itself stands about 12\" high, which is more than enough to be in reasonable proportion with my large porch pots. I was surprised at how realistic they look, especially at a distance. The branches can be bent and arranged so that the bushes appear quite natural. I buried the bases in the existing pot dirt and surrounded with river rock for stability because they are very lightweight, but I expect them to stay put with that little extra effort.","purchase_model":"Size: 18in Size: 18in  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-06 16:10:10"},{"user":"TAM09","content":"Seems very good quality.
