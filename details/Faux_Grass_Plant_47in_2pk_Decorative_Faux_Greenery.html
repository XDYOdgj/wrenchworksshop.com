They arrived in good shape and look great in Pottery Barn Mission Square planters. They are soft enough to sway nicely in a breeze but sturdy enough to stand up straight. They've held up well even after getting wet and being blown over by a storm. The only downside is some of the green dye washed off. You could see it in the standing water, but it isn't obvious on the leaves. They aren't waterproof faux plants, so we just moved them further away from the edge.","purchase_model":"Size: 5ft Size: 5ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-08 16:10:09"},{"user":"Kenneth C.","content":"I love this.

This is the first one I\u2019ve had, and I am very pleased with the look and the feel of this product. Could not tell the difference from the real thing, and it will never change appearance. I put it inside, and it looks beautiful with my rustic, beach theme. Very happy with his purchase, would highly recommend.","purchase_model":"Size: 4ft Size: 4ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-23 16:10:09"},{"user":"L.Williams","content":"\r\nThe media could not be loaded.\r\n","purchase_model":"Size: 5ft Size: 5ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-02 16:10:09"},{"user":"Joan H.","content":"These far exceeded my expectations!!They are very reasonably priced.I bought the 4 foot and raised them about 6 inches in my urns.They look really real.Their color is a mix of greens and yellows and the different grass lengths make them very realistic.I have been looking for this type of grass for awhile.In door or out door they look great!!2 are under my porch and 2 are outside so I will have to see how they hold up in the sun.But first impression is I absolutely love them!!","purchase_model":"Size: 4ft Size: 4ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-29 16:10:09"},{"user":"Amy","content":"Just what I was hoping for, filled in the spot perfectly.","purchase_model":"Size: 4ft Size: 4ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-06 16:10:09"},{"user":"Douglas Green","content":"I had ordered just one plant thinking only one would be enough.
