These look real and can be sprayed off and cleaned when they get dusty. Hold up very well.

They even have a little color fade on the leaves. More like a transition from a darker green to a lighter yellowy green making it look natural. These are high quality and sturdy and the colors are very beautiful. There are also many arms or stalks within the individual flower bunch...... Maybe that didn't make sense, but if you look at the pictures you'll understand. The only negative that I see is they do look a little shiny plasticy, but they are still very realistic looking. I needed something heavy duty and definitely weather resistant that still looked nice and realistic..... Our summers reach 108 plus so we'll see how it holds up... Delivery was fast like usual and packaged nicely...... I would highly recommend.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 20 Color: Magenta  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-02 16:10:11"},{"user":"Janie","content":"Held up all fall during a drought.

I placed them in planters in front of the house b/c half the day its too hot and sunny and live plants die, and the other half of the day its too shady. Tired of flowers dying. Up close, of course you can tell that they're artificial but from the street they look great! Such a vibrant color. One order of 20 bundles was enough for my 3 planters.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 20 Color: Magenta  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-22 16:10:11"},{"user":"Martindale","content":"no one ( from the street) can tellthey are not real.....","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 20 Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-26 16:10:11"},{"user":"Bunnie","content":"Bought the artificial flowers as the price of real flowers out of my range.
