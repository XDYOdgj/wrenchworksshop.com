I generally put many potted plants around my deck, some up under the roof over hang, causing much watering throughout the summer.I got these for that area and will still put live plants out where they get rain. These will save money over the long run seeing they will be here for years. They have plastic smell, but they are outside, it will go away.I bought 2 and was very happy with them so I purchased 2 more. Very pleased with product ??",

They have destroyed my beautiful garden. It\u2019s also super fun to not have to water or maintain. They last a very long time even in the full sun of ourWretched hot and miserable summers. You need to buy way more than you think you need. A fullContainer or planter keeps it from looking fake. These are a great investment. I\u2019ll be buying more.","purchase_model":"Color: Lavender-purple Color: Lavender-purple  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-08 16:10:09"},{"user":"Linda shaw","content":"I used these as a filler for a LARGE crock on my porch, and they looked beautiful! I added moss around the bottom and they looked real! And, no watering!

Right then I knew that I could afford to have a beautiful yard and maintain a low water bill for the SUMMER!Well, I was shocked and sold on the idea of searching for ARTIFICIAL PLANTS with UV GUARANTEED PROTECTED WITH A NON FADE GUARANTEE!!!I found them with AMAZON!!!They look great!!!!

Just be sure to order plenty to fill your planter.

Love them in the vase and they are a pretty good amount. The photo is about half what you get. I still have a lot more left. Made of a durable plastic but realistic - I\u2019d definitely buy these again. I intend to make a back patio bouquet with these. They will provide a lot of good color and seem to be sturdy enough to withstand outside conditions. These are a great deal!","purchase_model":"Color: Lavender-fushia Color: Lavender-fushia  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-09-19 16:10:09"},{"user":"kelzum","content":"These are beautiful and cost effective. I generally put many potted plants around my deck, some up under the roof over hang, causing much watering throughout the summer.I got these for that area and will still put live plants out where they get rain. These will save money over the long run seeing they will be here for years. They have plastic smell, but they are outside, it will go away.I bought 2 and was very happy with them so I purchased 2 more. Very pleased with product ??","purchase_model":"Color: Lavender-purple Color: Lavender-purple  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-04-02 16:10:09"}];
