I thought these would look cheap like something my great grandmother would have but these are gorgeous, vibrant color and since they are bendable we were able to make it look imperfect (not like a dead giveaway that they are in perfect formation). The true test was the UPS driver who just asked where we got blooming florals in early February! Highly recommend.

Decided to invest in some UVA safe artificials and these were them. So far no fading although here in Pennsylvania the sun isn't that strong in the fall when I will use them.
