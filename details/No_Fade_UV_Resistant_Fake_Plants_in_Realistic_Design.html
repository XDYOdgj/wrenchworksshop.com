Looks very realistic. Has yellow tinged tops that mimic real evergreens. This plant wShould be usable all season and will fit into each season decor which is a plus. I shook gently to fluff. Lost a few stems but not a concern. You get several bunches in one order. I used to fill a planter box on porch. Just love how it turned out. See pics.","purchase_model":"Color: 4#green Color: 4#green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-31 16:10:11"},{"user":"carol","content":"I finally got sick of my plants dying and having to replace them every year. I picked these because they look believable as evergreens so they won't look stupid and out of place in the winter.In my pics, the \"plants\" you see highlighted are each made of 4 bunches of these fake plants. One order comes with 8 bunches which made 2 plants of the size you see in my pics. I purchased this item 2 times, for a total 16 bunches that I made into 4 fake plants.I used these to fill in some holes in my landscape and mixed them in with my real plants. I think they mesh well with the real and are undetectable. See arrows and markings pointing to the fake ones.I bought some 6\" garden staples to hold them down so they won't fly away on a stormy day. Just criss cross two garden staples and try to catch all the stems and pound into the ground with a rubber mallet (or a rock). Cover it up with dirt and/or mulch. It only took me a few mins per plant. Easy.","purchase_model":"Color: 4#green Color: 4#green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-06 16:10:11"},{"user":"S.

For two matching pots, we put together some of these flowers, in white, mixed with the bundles of just greens, and we also used some sprigs from another set from a different brand (Grunyia). Very happy with how these turned out.","purchase_model":"Color: 5#white Color: 5#white  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-17 16:10:11"},{"user":"ottersfknit","content":"I'm a gardener, so I'm averse to artificial; however, have been trying to grow something in containers by front door for years.Nothing takes.I ceded to these sprigs.They have varied shades on the branches lending credibility,and they are easy to shape.Now I'm happy with front doorway.","purchase_model":"Color: 4#green Color: 4#green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-09 16:10:11"},{"user":"Anonymous","content":"For years I tried to have real plants on my porch and for years all I did was fought ants. Every time I would water, the ants would come. Knowing that termites' favorite food is ants, my husband insisted I stop with the real plants. So I bought the one that's all greenery that looks kinda like rosemary and tried it. It has light and dark leaves and looks pretty darn realistic! I've had it out now for almost a year and even through a winter with -20 degree temps and it looks brand new. I had intended to put other plants with it but didn't it looked so good. This year I bough a burgundy grass spike to add to the center for something different.By the way, I was getting landscapes quotes on another project and saw the guy I was speaking with sneak a feel to see if it was real. Even he thought so...Ha.","purchase_model":"Color: 4#green Color: 4#green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-06-02 16:10:11"},{"user":"Benjamin","content":"Awesome ??","purchase_model":"Color: 4#green Color: 4#green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-07 16:10:11"}];
