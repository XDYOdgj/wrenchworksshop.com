UV Resistant Artificial Boxwood Plant as part of the Amazon Vine program in exchange for my honest review. After using this product extensively, here are my thoughts.First Impressions:The product arrived well-packaged and in perfect condition. Upon unboxing, I thought they looked a little small, but as I fluffed up the arms of the twigs, it grew on me and I was excited to put these in pots in front of our house.Design and Build Quality:The build quality feels durable and I think they will do well in the elements outside. The stakes hold them snugly in place and I have no fears that they will blow away in the wind. The plastic is high in quality and looks very real.Ease of Use:The trees were very easy to assemble and only took about 10 minutes to fully extend the arms. There were no instructions, but the parts are intuitive to use.Pros:- Quality materials- Easy to set up- Look fairly realCons:- On the small sideOverall Experience:Overall, my experience with the product has been positive and these are a great addition to our front steps.Would I Recommend It?:Yes, I would highly recommend the Nearly Natural 2.5ft. UV Resistant Artificial Boxwood Plant to anyone who struggles to keep real plants alive or wants a \"real\" look without the upkeep.Disclaimer:I am a professional product reviewer whose work can be seen on some of the nation's largest publishing websites.

Each Boxwood Plant stands 36\u201d tall and the width of the plant is approximately 11\u201d wide. I was kinda skeptical about ordering these for my front porch because I thought they might look really artificial but when they were delivered and I opened the box, I was really surprised on how lifelike, green & plush these really looked. They can be used as decoration inside or outside of your home. If you want to use these outdoors, don\u2019t worry because these Boxwood Plants are very durable, they are not only UV resistant, they are weather resistant (meaning rain & snow will not hurt these plants) as well. When these Boxwood plants are delivered in the box they come in, you may have to straighten a few branches and fluff up the greenery before placing them in a planter but you will not have to do much to them before they are ready to set out. They come with the stakes to put on the end for easy planting. These decorative artificial Boxwood plants will give you endless decorative opportunities. These would be an excellent housewarming gift to someone. I really like these Boxwood plants and I highly recommend these to others!","purchase_model":"Size: 3ft.
