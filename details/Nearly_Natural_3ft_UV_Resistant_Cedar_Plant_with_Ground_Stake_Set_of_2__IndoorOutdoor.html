UV Resistant Artificial Cedar Plant: This set of two 3-foot artificial trees arrived in a compact box. I didn't see any instructions in the box and forgot to go back to this listing to read tips, as it seemed pretty intuitive to set them up. As I shaped/fluffed the branches, about a half-dozen small pieces of greenery fell off each tree, but it still made a decent shape. You could leave them more compact if wanted for a tighter space. I didn't want to push the branches down too much and lose more pieces, so mine are pretty skinny looking. The trees simply drop loosely into the included ground stake so they are a little wobbly; it would be better if the stake could be screwed in tightly to make them a little more stable (I'm curious to see what happens when it's really windy). I didn't dig a hole first; instead, I pushed the stake into the ground with the tree attached, which worked well except the disc at the top broke when I stepped too hard on one (my fault for not reading the instructions in this listing). But I feel they will be sturdier in the ground with just the stake pushed in rather than digging a bigger hole and having to fill it back in. I covered the tops of the discs with mulch and they look good! The list price seems a little high ($156 for the set at the time I posted this review), but if you can buy them on sale, I recommend giving them a try. (There is also currently a 2-foot set for a much lower price.)","purchase_model":"Size: 3ft.

Took some time to get them to look like \u201ctwins,\u201d but it was kind of enjoyable to do. They are similar to other outdoor trees I have and while they look and feel fake when up very close, they look great in my outdoor pots and no one would know they weren\u2019t real.I got the 2.5 to put in some raised pots and with the extender stake, they are a good height for that. If my pots were on the ground flush, I would probably recommend the taller size. Overall, happy with these and I will keep them in my pots year round.","purchase_model":"Size: 2.5ft   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-09 16:10:09"},{"user":"Sunward","content":"I ordered the two pack of the 3ft. plants. The actual plant portion is definitely smaller than 3ft, so I'm assuming that measurement counts the ground spike as part of it. These are a nice believable green color, and the individual branches are dense, with some spacing between branches. This is basically like a mini artificial Christmas tree, and each branch has to be \"fluffed\" out from the center to make it the full shape. I am using these at a front gate where I've tried to plant a couple of different types of bushes with no success (observe the beautiful yellow grass in the pictures) because I don't have a watering source nearby. These are the perfect solution for that. Overall, very happy with these little faux bushes.","purchase_model":"Size: 3ft.   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-11 16:10:09"},{"user":"Rev.
