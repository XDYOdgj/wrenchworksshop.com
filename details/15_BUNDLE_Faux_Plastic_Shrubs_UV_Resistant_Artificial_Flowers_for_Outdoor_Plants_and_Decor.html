I purchased white and pink in the spring. They have been on my porch covered for several months and still look brand new. No fading as well.I purchased these orange ones to switch out from pink for the fall. The blooms are a bit smaller than the last ones I bought, but they still look great. And no funky plastic smell either. Will be buying more in the future!","purchase_model":"Color: Orange Color: Orange  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-15 16:10:11"},{"user":"Lily9","content":"I replaced my worn out flowers with these in whiskey barrel pots.

I was happy that the deep purple was true to the photo, and the bunches are so plentiful. I had more than enough for 2 wreaths and a few bunches left over to add to my bathroom floral arrangement. I added deep red flowers as well to the wreaths which match my outdoor floral plantings, so gorgeous.","purchase_model":"Color: Purple Color: Purple  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-06-16 16:10:11"},{"user":"Darby Holloway","content":"I bought my first set several months ago bc I wanted something that would look pretty all fall and not die. I know some faux flowers look fake but I was very impressed with these! The color is so vibrant! I bought the orange, black & purple for Halloween. Last week I bought the yellow to go with the orange for Thanksgiving and they both look brand new! I have them in a large pot on my porch. When you receive them, they are tight in a box but the leaves expand, making it look fuller when they're all together. (My last picture shows the difference.) I believe they look just like the picture provided on Amazon and will definitely be buying more, especially the red for Christmas!!","purchase_model":"Color: Yellow Color: Yellow  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-08 16:10:11"},{"user":"Shelie","content":"So pretty and the made it through a Florida hurricane.
