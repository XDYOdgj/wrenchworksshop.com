Great quality, looks real and had weight to it keeping it stable in the pots.So far holding up in the sun, rain, snow, ice and hard wind.","purchase_model":"Size: 3ft Size: 3ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-18 16:10:10"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"I really like these trees. I got them for my pots at my front door. I will say there is a strategy to separating the branches. I actually found a video and it was super helpful because before that they looked kind of fake and really bare.After messing with the bending and fanning they looked great and they look pretty real.They were great for putting little lights on for Christmas as well","purchase_model":"Size: 4ft Size: 4ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-16 16:10:10"},{"user":"Southernbelle","content":"This is the cutest little tree.Perfect size for my deck here in SC.I wanted a plant that could stay out all year long in all weather situations.I bought a ceramic pot to put it in.I wanted it weighted down sufficiently when we get winds (I live on the 2nd floor). This is solid even without being put into an additional pot.It was easy to spread the branches and make it look nicer.I lost very minimum leaves, so if you are careful this should not present a problem.I added southern moss to my tree in the pot to secure it so it would always stand up straight.This is even better than I imagined it would be.I only bought 1 but this is a great little purchase.I recommend anyone investing in this gem!","purchase_model":"Size: 3ft Size: 3ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-01 16:10:10"},{"user":"Olga","content":"I bought these for my porch since all the real plants die. (No enough sunlight) they look great just don\u2019t fluff them too aggressively or some of the little stems will come off and trying to find from where is a pain. They get a little morning sun and the color still looks good, no fading. From the side walk one would think they\u2019re real.","purchase_model":"Size: 4ft Size: 4ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-29 16:10:10"},{"user":"Michael D.","content":"Muy embellecedor.

I love it when people compliment them, then I tell them they are fake, and everyone goes to touch them. I have had them for several months, no fading, and they look real. They have survivied the north Texas sun, winter winds and rain and look the same. I bought some plastic containers, filled them with concrete power, hosed in some water, and they set. Nothing falls over in the wind.","purchase_model":"Size: 5ft Size: 5ft  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-12 16:10:10"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"Got tired trying to find plants for my porch pot.
