I was concerned straight out of the box that they didn’t look real enough, but once we hung them up, they look great. Yes, if you go up to them and really look you can tell. But they make a beautiful addition of color, especially in this heatwave/drought. Only downside is the birds think so too so now I have a birds nest in one. I’d suggest if you don’t want the same, use some long screws and put them in the center so it doesn’t leave room for a nest or to perch. The flat side of the screws won’t hurt them but it will keep it from being a good place to nest.",

My first time buying something like this so wasn\u2019t sure how it was going to work out. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased though. I bought 3 different ones, they all came packed as shown in the pics. Easy to assemble, just make sure you have the flat white foam side down and the rounded greenery side up. I had it backwards at first ?????\u2640? Then just evenly space them apart and poke the stems in and your done! I hung them out behind my pool on the wall and they look amazing!! Everyone says how pretty they are and are totally surprised when I tell them they are artificial. I leave them out 24 / 7 and they have withstood multiple thunderstorms with high winds, and remain intact and beautiful!! Of course being in Texas, the nonstop triple digit sun has taken a toll on the color. The red ones have faded considerably, but I expected that. They still look good, just not as vivid as you can see in the last 2 pics.Definitely worth the money!! They really added a nice touch to my pool!!

I bought four for across my front porch. In past years, I used real flowers and they would look great for a couple of weeks and then start to look sad and brown. I saw these and am so happy I took a chance. We\u2019ve received MANY compliments and no one realized they were fake until we told them. They are zero maintenance on hot summer days and didn\u2019t fade one bit. I\u2019m a huge fan!!!","purchase_model":"Color: Rose Red Color: Rose Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-28 16:10:11"},{"user":"Bobbie Martin","content":"Very prettyeasy to put together hold up in the wind","purchase_model":"Color: Purple Color: Purple  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-11 16:10:11"},{"user":"Jodi Hoscheid","content":"Bought two of these for my front porch and I\u2019m really happy with the purchase. I was concerned straight out of the box that they didn\u2019t look real enough, but once we hung them up, they look great. Yes, if you go up to them and really look you can tell. But they make a beautiful addition of color, especially in this heatwave/drought. Only downside is the birds think so too so now I have a birds nest in one. I\u2019d suggest if you don\u2019t want the same, use some long screws and put them in the center so it doesn\u2019t leave room for a nest or to perch. The flat side of the screws won\u2019t hurt them but it will keep it from being a good place to nest.","purchase_model":"Color: Rose Red Color: Rose Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-06-24 16:10:11"}];
