I came across these red geraniums and thought I\u2019d give them a try. I\u2019m an avid gardener so I know flowers :). These look so real and vibrantI ended up ordering 18 stems and I\u2019m happy with the fullness.Try them!!!I had seen some reviews that said they were smashed.Maybe a few but they perk right up!","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 6 Color: Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-15 16:10:11"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"I'm so impressed with the quality of these!

This package 20 bundles. They arrive tightly package so when unwrapping them you should use a little care because some the the flowers can be pulled off. They do reattach fairly easily if this happens. There\u2019s also a bit of a plastic odor but once you air them out the odor dissipates fairly quickly. I usually spread the bundle out by hand but it is also recommended to use a hair dryer or swish them in water and it will help open up the flowers and make the bundle easier to arrange. I used 10 bundles to arrange the pot in these photos and I still have another one to arrange but since it is winter I am not in a hurry.These silk flowers look so realistic and are well worth the $17-35 ( depending on the number of bundles in the package). They are weather resistant and although I haven\u2019t had them directly in the sun as of yet they are to be resistant to fading. The best thing about these silk flowers is even though you have not given them a drop of water and they will be the best looking flowers in the entire neighborhood.","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 6 Color: Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-29 16:10:11"},{"user":"Marc P. Angeles","content":"This is a great set of fake flowers. I have had quite a few different styles of fake flowers and geraniums do look pretty good. This particular set has the center stemans the same color as the flower, which in my opinion help it look more realistic. There also is a little bit of a fade on the pedal so on most of them the center is slightly darker.The leaves on these are one color on the top and a different color underneath on the bottom. It doesn't seem to have a huge effect on how realistic it is but they are cut out with basically a wave stamp around the edge of the leaf. That is absolutely the same on every pedal. That is the main issue with the fakeness of these. The top of the leaf does have a few different colors in it though, so overall it is a reasonable fake.These would look great anywhere where someone isn't going to walk up and touch them or look at them too closely.","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 12 Color: Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-11 16:10:11"},{"user":"Pratik Shrestha","content":"Beautiful stunning flowers. The quality of the flowers definitely impressed me. The colors are maroon, and life like. If the color is too bright, and shiny it looks like plastic. This has the perfect color that makes the flowers pop, and look real. Absolutely love that the attention was not just put on the flowers, but also the leaves. The leaves also look realistic, and I'm very happy with the quantity, and quality. This would look outdoor, or indoor.","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 12 Color: Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-18 16:10:11"},{"user":"LCS","content":"I have always enjoyed pictures of alleyways in the Iberian peninsula, where pots of red geraniums hang in rows on the exterior walls. No chance of being able to do that in the desert, where pots bake out by 10 a.m.and things only get worse from there! So it was wonderful to receive this generous bundle of very natural-looking \"faux\" geraniums that are UV resistant. The stems are sturdy and very flexible, with great-looking leaves and natural shading of the flower centers.","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 12 Color: Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-17 16:10:11"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"When I received the box of geraniums there were smooshed but I was able to fluff them up after positioning them. There were 12 in the set, and are a bright red color and quite full, from the flower heads to the leaves. They have bendable stems, and I\u2019m hoping they will be easy to arrange in the baskets I plan on buying.I will be putting them in 2 hanging baskets and hanging them in my Lanai. Looking forward to setting them up.

We travel in our RV so I can never grow flowers due to the care they need. This was the perfect solution for me. You get twelve stems which go a long ways. they are very bright and the flowers are convincingly real. If you use your thumb to gently pop out the leaf it looks realistic. The second picture is just four of the 12 stems. They are soft and don't look or feel plastic to me and the flowers seem pretty secure.I will stick them in some foam in a container and they will really give some color to my deck.","purchase_model":"Number of Items: 12 Color: Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-08 16:10:11"},{"user":"Erin Stiles","content":"I don\u2019t have a green thumb, in fact my husband teases and says I have a brown thumb.
