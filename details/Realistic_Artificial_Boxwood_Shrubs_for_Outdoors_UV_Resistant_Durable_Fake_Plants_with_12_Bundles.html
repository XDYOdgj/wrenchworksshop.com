I have been unsuccessful for 11 years at trying to create a beautiful landscape. The needs are just so different in comparison to what I'm used to from the mid-west. I finally hit my wits end and decided that maybe it's time to try to create a beautiful landscape using artificial plants. So far, it has been a success. I wanted artificial flowers, with beautiful colors, to add to the front of my house for curb appeal and while we are sitting outside enjoying the day/evening. After receiving these 12 bundles of artificial flowers, I separated the branches and fluffed them up so to speak. I then added them to both of my artificial hanging plants to add color and some height. From a distance they look real but as you get closer, at least within 3 feet of the plants, it is obvious that they are artificial. That is not an issue for me though, as I love how lively these artificial plants makes the front of my house look. They make me happy and I'm constantly getting compliments on them from friends, family, and even our UPS and FedEx delivery people.","purchase_model":"Size: 12 Bundles Color: Mix  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-08 16:10:09"},{"user":"DebV","content":"I love to \"deck out my deck\" with flowers, ferns and herbs, however there is a great deal of space on/around my deck where I am unable to keep flower baskets because they do not get near enough sun for their needs.These artificial flowers should do just the trick to fill in some of those spots with some color and greenery.To be fair, they are plastic and you're not going to be fooling anyone that they are real at least from any close proximity.But considering I'm typically the only person actually \"on\" my deck of my condo and anyone else who would see them would be seeing from the road, I think these will be perfect.Love that they sell as a bundle of 12 so one order is plenty enough to build out a nice full basket.","purchase_model":"Size: 12 Bundles Color: Mix  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-05 16:10:09"},{"user":"Brian","content":"This is an amazing set of artificial flowers that look very real.They come bundled up but it's very easy to spread them out to fill a planter.The colors are vibrant and the mimic real flowers perfectly.Even bees think they are real!","purchase_model":"Size: 12 Bundles Color: Mix  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-28 16:10:09"},{"user":"Wendy Reviews","content":"I\u2019m planning to use these flowers this spring to complement the live ones I\u2019ll be planting in my mailbox planter. Last year, I used artificial flowers, and they held up quite well. However, the colors have faded over time, so it\u2019s time for a refresh. These new ones have vibrant colors that look fantastic.One thing I found puzzling was that some bundles came in plastic covers while others weren\u2019t protected at all. The uncovered pieces seemed to have lost some floral parts, likely due to shifting around in the box during shipping. Despite this minor issue, the price is excellent\u2014just over a dollar per stem\u2014and the quality is impressive for the cost.","purchase_model":"Size: 12 Bundles Color: Mix  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-03 16:10:09"},{"user":"DG615","content":"These are very good looking flowers.It's a nice big bundle so I am able to get a couple of smaller pots out of them.I like doing several medium sized pots on the deck versus one large one and this is a good set for that.","purchase_model":"Size: 12 Bundles Color: Mix  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-15 16:10:09"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"These are pretty, not too fake looking and just the right amount of vibrance to brighten any room.
