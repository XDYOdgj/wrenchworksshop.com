Very reusable.Instead of having a coffee pot, I put a couple scoops of coffee in one of the bags, and let it sit like tea.Sometimes I get some grounds at the bottom of my cup if I dip the bag too much but it\u2019s not gonna hurt ya.Cleaning them is easy.If you have a sink trap, good.Turn the sink on, gently turn the bag inside out, and let the water push the coffee or tea ground out.Catch everything you can In trap.I have a small glass jar that fits perfectly inside the bags. So that\u2019s how I dry them.I\u2019m very satisfied with these and if I ever decide to make some edibles, I might use these bags instead of regular cheese cloth.","purchase_model":"Size: X-Small,4 PACK   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-10 16:10:04"},{"user":"heather ingram","content":"Purchased a set of these to contain herbs and spices to steep in soups and broths as we come in to the cooler temps.
