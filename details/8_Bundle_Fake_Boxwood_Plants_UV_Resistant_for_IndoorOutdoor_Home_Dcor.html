			var commentsList = [{"user":"Maria","content":"UV Resistant & Durable. Realistic Appearance. The boxwood plants look incredibly realistic, and it's hard to tell that they aren\u2019t real! The rich green color and the detailed texture of the leaves make them look like genuine plants, which is exactly what I was hoping for. These faux plants are UV resistant, which is perfect for outdoor use. I\u2019ve had them out in the sun for a a whole seasonnow, and they haven\u2019t faded or shown any signs of wear. The material feels sturdy and durable, able to withstand outdoor conditions like wind and rain, which is key for artificial plants used outside.","purchase_model":"Size: 8 Bundles Color: Green Grass  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-16 16:10:09"},{"user":"echobunny","content":"I got the 8 bundles of the purple boxwood to replace the dead flowers in my hanging basket and I\u2019m pleased with how they look.8 was sufficient for my smallish basket and I think it looks great, but I think 10-12 would\u2019ve given it a fuller look. The color is vibrant and more of a fucshia color than purple. It\u2019s very pretty.The stems were a bit long, so I just pushed them at an angle into the center of the pot and that worked for me. I\u2019m sure they could be cut, but I left them as is in case I want to use them elsewhere. 5 flowers fell off upon opening the package, but it\u2019s not noticeable that any are missing and I could\u2019ve pushed them back on the plant.This is a nice option for those who want the color of flowers without the maintenance. I thought the price was great for what I received.","purchase_model":"Size: 8 Bundles Color: Boxwood-purple  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-06-03 16:10:09"},{"user":"Nina315","content":"So, yeah.... here I am at 78, eating my heart out that the deer have multiplied so much here that even professional spraying won't deter them from making my garden a BAMBI BUFFET!Buy a dibber ( I bought the Garden Guru Steel Dibber) and poke these in one at a time; and in no time at all, you will have a lovely presentation of \"annuals\" that everyone will admire as they drive by. Even up close they are pretty good looking. I added the Jutom 36 Pcs Artificial Flowers in pink.At the end of the season I will remove them, hose and dry them, and put them away for next Spring.These are so quick to \"plant\" that you will not dread putting them back in the ground next year.","purchase_model":"Size: 8 Bundles Color: Grass - Blue  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-04 16:10:09"},{"user":"Rene'","content":"These are fabulous! Just what my Mother wanted. My Mom has wanted some colorful flowers on her patio,it she really doesn\u2019t like to garden, be in the heat, water them, etc. So we ordered these for her, \u201cplanted\u201d them and then brought her outside. She actually did a little jig. Honestly, from her kitchen window they look like fresh flowers and brighten up her patio. Highly recommend.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-28 16:10:09"},{"user":"LovingLife","content":"this was my second order.I ordered the purple first and was very satisfied with the color and how well made they were.I placed a second order in red to place in an outdoor flower box.You can tell they are artificial unless you get down close and scrutinize them.Will probably order more.","purchase_model":"Size: 8 Bundles Color: Boxwood-red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-07 16:10:09"},{"user":"Brenda","content":"I used the greenery in potting urns on either side of my walk at the bottom of my front entrance.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-21 16:10:09"},{"user":"MaryG","content":"There were nothing do dislike.
