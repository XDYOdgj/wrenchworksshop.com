Beautiful color, quality materials, and the size is stunning. (I purchased the large) and was on the fence with the price BUT I’m so glad I did.I opened them up ( you have to “pet” them several times to bend the leaves in a more spanned style. Take your time. I purchase ceramic pots and turned a plastic pot upside down and cut a circle out that gave the stem stability so I wouldn’t have to use as much rock. I placed it upside down (pot opening in bottom/cut hole on top) then filled the sides with cheap white filler rock. DO NOT put the pebble sized rocks as this will clog the drain holes at the bottom if you need to spray these down. Then I topped the pots with white river rock.Love the look and adds a pop of color to the yard. Buy them if you’re in the fence!! You won’t regret it!P.S. I live in Vegas where it gets up to 120° so I’ll keep you posted on the durability. So far so great!!",

Beautiful color, quality materials, and the size is stunning. (I purchased the large) and was on the fence with the price BUT I\u2019m so glad I did.I opened them up ( you have to \u201cpet\u201d them several times to bend the leaves in a more spanned style. Take your time. I purchase ceramic pots and turned a plastic pot upside down and cut a circle out that gave the stem stability so I wouldn\u2019t have to use as much rock. I placed it upside down (pot opening in bottom/cut hole on top) then filled the sides with cheap white filler rock. DO NOT put the pebble sized rocks as this will clog the drain holes at the bottom if you need to spray these down. Then I topped the pots with white river rock.Love the look and adds a pop of color to the yard. Buy them if you\u2019re in the fence!! You won\u2019t regret it!P.S. I live in Vegas where it gets up to 120\u00b0 so I\u2019ll keep you posted on the durability. So far so great!!","purchase_model":"Size: Large Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-08 16:10:09"}];
