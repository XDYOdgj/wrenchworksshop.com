I am happy to report that the mission has been accomplished.Maybe these little boxwoods can achieve that for you, too. My blueprint follows.I paired them with a black Verel set of two \u201ctall outdoor planters\u201d (tall, in this case, means a towering 24 vertical inches) found elsewhere on Amazon. The boxwoods are potted in something heavy; the planters are feather light, but do give the appearance of being substantial.Surmising that top heavy was a recipe for a tipping disaster, I loaded the planters with four bricks each, put the plant insert in, set a boxwood in that, and filled it with soil. Viola! Instant front door showcase!The soil made it all so authentic. Details mean everything here. Don\u2019t get lazy at the end.One small caveat. Some branches sprung loose and I put them back in with rubber cement. It wasn\u2019t a challenge; I did it holding a gin and tonic in one hand.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-08-09 16:10:10"},{"user":"Linda Loving-Graham","content":"Good value and good color.","purchase_model":"Size: 2 FT Color: Topiary5  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-04 16:10:10"},{"user":"Joie30","content":"The quality is so good.
