And these are quite miniature blooms which makes them really adorable. I plan to stick them into floral foam and then set the whole arrangement into planters which I will hang on my balcony rail.Right now it is February though so this isn\u2019t a project I am doing quite yet.But what I have found is that I kept those flowers in its original box (open) and the smell of the plastic is really strong! This is probably not a flower arrangement to keep indoors as who knows with what toxic chemical these were treated.","purchase_model":"Color: 6 Colors 12pcs Color: 6 Colors 12pcs  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-12 16:10:09"},{"user":"Renee Stevens","content":"5 STARS! All the way. These are some of the most realistic artificial flowers I've owned. They're so life like, I've had people stop and admire them, and they'd not have known they were fake had I not told them. The greenery and the blooms alike are just so well done. ????They're vibrant and colorful, they add a splash of summer to my patio table.I live in Vegas, with some of the hottest sun known to man, so I'll tell you post haste if they begin to fade come summertime, but so far, so good!Bottom line: these flowers are so real looking, they've fooled folks. They're high-quality, top of the line artificial flowers that really brighten up my patio area. I highly recommend them to anyone shopping for foliage that needs no green finger to survive!","purchase_model":"Color: Orange Flower 12pcs Color: Orange Flower 12pcs  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-22 16:10:09"},{"user":"Hen","content":"I don't normally use many artificial plants, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from these. But they look very nice and come in many convenient sized little bunches so you can adjust how bushy you want them to be, and also easily mix them with other artificial flowers if you have them.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-01 16:10:09"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"Cute flowers! Came in a 12 piece pack, I put them in 3 little vases around my apartment. The red/orange color is nice! Only con - the box they came in was too small, so a lot of the flowers came bent. Luckily the top pieces of the stems came off, so I was able to remove the pieces that were most bent","purchase_model":"Color: Orange Flower 12pcs Color: Orange Flower 12pcs  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-23 16:10:09"},{"user":"Tweezle","content":"When I first opened the box, I was just a bit disappointed but when I really looked at the flowers and the detail, I really started to fall in love with them. The look amazing in a pot - like I had spent a fortune on the arrangement. I like that I don't have to water and they look great. These were originally gotten for a candle, but they are really too nice for that. I'm going to be putting these out as soon as the snow leaves as they will be an impressive sight all spring/summer!!! I love these little guys!","purchase_model":"Color: Purple Flower 12cps Color: Purple Flower 12cps  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-08 16:10:09"},{"user":"Owlbeardo","content":"These are fantastic.
