It has an open 18\" square metal box type base that just needs something so it doesn't look so boring. I have built up the bottom with pavers so if I add some floral foam base (We don't get much rain in So Cal so this is doable!) these should work well at 13.8 inches long.These arrived tightly wrapped in plastic wrap but they seem to have quite a bit of flexibility so they will look lush after I shape them. I like that these flowers have different flower heads so that they have more of a real appearance. I think adding these bunches of flowers will add a pop of color that will look like real flowers, especially since it sits at a distance. I love that these are purported to be UV resistant so that they maintain some color vibrancy over time. I don't hold out hope for more than a few seasons though because my patio has sun exposure for the entire afternoon, but I'll keep my fingers crossed. I find them to be a good price for 20 bunches. I plan to 'plant' them at the beginning of March when our rainy season is over. I'll add a photo after but wanted to let other potential buyers that may be on the fence that these are nice artificial flowers.","purchase_model":"Color: Fuchsia Color: Fuchsia  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-02 16:10:11"},{"user":"T.
