			var commentsList = [{"user":"2Lilac2","content":"Impressive quality of these flowers. They arrive in a deceptively small box, bundled,but have robust wiring to them thst allows you to easily spread them open, bend and resend, without breakage. These sturdy stems have outstanding vibrant color that my friends say lasts a long time (months to a year, at least). At this price point, I don't care if they only last a month- they are cheaper than a fresh bouquet and a marvelous bit of color before real flowers bloom. Am impressed with their quality and the fun I had arranging them. It was easy to poke a bundle in and then move it to they something else. Arranging them took less than 5 minutes.","purchase_model":"Size: 9 Bundles Color: Multi Color  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-10 16:10:11"},{"user":"Chandi","content":"- I'm quite pumped about these since the lower Alabama heat has killed/ sunburned all my flowers. no rain, etc etc etc, blah blah.-pictured is 1 bundle ( 9? I think. Whatever the cheapest purchase option is, that's the one I have in picture for reference.)Anyways, I've had these flowers for a whopping 4 hours now, and I'm quite impressed . The price range is within my broke economy budget, which is great, and the nosey Nancy neighbor commented on how pretty they are while she was on her nosey afternoon walk.-... Thanks, Nancy.-The flowers are vacuumed sealed(?) really tightly for shipping of course; so please please please be an adult with some sense and fluff the damn fake \" faux\" flower before you stick it in the flower pot or wherever you see fit...Again, great flowers, great price point,etc.If they suck or start to fade in a few months I'm okay with that due to price point. Only time will tell. Hell, I spend more wasted money inside the Gas stations daily. Buy it.- The end.","purchase_model":"Size: 9 Bundles Color: Multi Color  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-21 16:10:11"},{"user":"David N.","content":"I originally purchased to use in my Sister\u2019s garden. She has several debilitating medical conditions and can no longer manage gardening. They were placing their house on the market in early March. I wanted to spruce up the front porch garden for a nice curb appeal effect. I spent a ton of time reviewing many other outdoor artificial plants and then selected these. They DID NOT disappoint. The plans for use at my Sisters garden didn\u2019t end up happening. So here I was with 2 sets of these lovely flowers. I hesitantly decided to give them a try in my flower bed. Wow!They look amazing bordering my bed. Gardening is my favorite hobby. However with my second hip replacement being just 2 months ago, I am trying to incorporate ways the reduce the physical demands of gardening. So many family and friends compliment on these plants and asked me what they are\u2026even standing just a couple feet away. When I tell them they are plastic we all have a good laugh. You really cannot tell until you are very close. Highly recommend!!!! The number/quantity of stems in this set is a great value as well!","purchase_model":"Size: 18 Bundles Color: Multi Color  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-05 16:10:11"},{"user":"Marlee J.
