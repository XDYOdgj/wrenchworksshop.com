I placed them in flower boxes that Will eventually go outside in the spring. Since I worked part time for a florist I am able to arrange them to look as natural as possible. I used more than most people because most people arrange faux too skimpy. They need to be fuller in a container . My home sits far back from the road and I feel the display needs to be more fuller. I am very pleased and can\u2019t wait till spring. I would recommend them especially if you have an area that is difficult to grow flowers.","purchase_model":"Color: Yellow Color: Yellow  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-19 16:10:11"},{"user":"Tammy Birge","content":"Purchased these for crafting really like themvery nice, quality is excellent and price is good too, definitely recommend","purchase_model":"Color: White Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-08 16:10:11"},{"user":"Dawnie Rowe","content":"These flowers look real and are a great option!
