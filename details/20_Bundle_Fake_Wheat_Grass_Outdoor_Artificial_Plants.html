The picture makes the flowers look more blue but in person they are purple still very well made. Did spray them with a UV clear gloss so they don\u2019t fade in the Floridasun .","purchase_model":"Color: Blue Color: Blue  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-18 16:10:09"},{"user":"beachbum","content":"They are a LOT smaller than the pictures make them appear to be. They are plastic with an odd smell when you first take them out of the packaging, and the flowers can come off during shipping. Easy enough to pop them back on the stem(s). They still get five stars because the price is right, and if you order enough of them-PRESTO!- a planter is filled with gorgeous, easy color. No fertilizing, no watering, no deadheading. Great for a high-wind drought area.They will and do fade in the sun, so just hit them with a coat of outdoor UV spray once a week or so and you have pretty, fuss-free flowers all spring & summer. I like them better than silk flowers and they last a lot longer.","purchase_model":"Color: White Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-02-16 16:10:09"},{"user":"W Potocki","content":"Bought a lot of the yellow ones for my front yard instead of buying real at the nursery. I'm a senior and got tired of watering flowers in the 100 degree days. I have gotten a lot of compliments from my neighbors, In fact, several have bought the same flowers for their yards. I bought pink and blue ones for the back yard two years ago. They are still in good shape. I recommend when you get them that you cut with scissors from the stem up to prevent losing any flowers.","purchase_model":"Color: Yellow Color: Yellow  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-09 16:10:09"},{"user":"Kimberly","content":"I use them for my outside scenery and works and looks great.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-10 16:10:09"},{"user":"nml","content":"\u201cPlanted\u201d them in pots where live plants were struggling.

Poinsettias are the only things that last a month. I had to buy a box for each one. They smell like a dirty ashtray out of the box. However, they are outside. Easy to fluff out. The color is really good. They do look fake when you look at them really closely and up close. They don\u2019t come with the pot or the foam. I got both at the Dollar Tree. I weighted them down with rocks because we live in Hurricane Central. Let\u2019s see how they hold up. ????","purchase_model":"Color: Red Color: Red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-06-23 16:10:09"},{"user":"Rima Maredia","content":"These are nice looking artifical garden plants they are bright and a good size and texture.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-25 16:10:09"},{"user":"Alfie","content":"Easy to arrange and looks great in our back stone wall planters.","purchase_model":"Color: Green Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-24 16:10:09"},{"user":"By Kris","content":"This is the second time I bought these in the past couple years........They are in a large rain barrel on our front mound.......looks real and critters don't eat and I don't have to go way out to water them........More than worth the money........various colors to choose from.......","purchase_model":"Color: Pink Color: Pink  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-17 16:10:09"}];
