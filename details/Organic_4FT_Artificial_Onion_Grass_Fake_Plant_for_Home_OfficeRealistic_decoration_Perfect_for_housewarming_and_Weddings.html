Great height to it, on the thinner side which i liked. I put in on the landing where my staircase makes a right turn. It fit in the corner perfect, small enough not to be in the way.","purchase_model":"Size: 5FT Number of Items: 1  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-19 16:10:09"},{"user":"LS","content":"This came well packaged with a plastic sleeve, and the weighted base secured. Once I removed the plastic sleeve, the grass spread, but stayed up right just like it would naturally. There's enough of the root bunches packed into the black plastic pot, that it's hard to see into the base of the pot, but I believe it has some kind of black rock on it. The leaves are detailed with the various shades of greens, pinks and tans, looking very realistic, in fact, I went to fan it out a little and every once in a while, I grabbed a spot that felt like grass or weeds do. So be careful you don't grab it just right, I'm not sure it would give you a paper cut, but it felt just like the real stuff, but not every where, it was random. The long blades ends taper, and are flexible and full. There is some variety in the heights of the blades. From even a couple feet away, this would be really hard to know if it was real or fake. Although I'm sure you can put this outdoors, I would suggest under a patio or porch awning, to keep it from holding too much water in case of rain or damage from high winds. Of course the real stuff would also be damaged in harsh weather, but it would grow back. This would be excellent inside or an entry area. I will be using mine in photo props, and it will be perfect for that. The pot is weighted enough to keep it stable, yet it's not heavy to move at all, just make sure you move it by the pot and don't pull the blades. Overall, this is a really good artificial plant, and I would highly recommend it. I hope this info has been helpful.","purchase_model":"Size: 4FT Number of Items: 1  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-28 16:10:09"},{"user":"RoseBLT","content":"This artificial onion grass is a great addition to my home!
