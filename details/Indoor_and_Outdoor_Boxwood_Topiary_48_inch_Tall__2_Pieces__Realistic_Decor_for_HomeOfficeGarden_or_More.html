These plants add a nice touch of greenery to my home without the hassle of maintaining real plants. The quality is great\u2014each topiary looks realistic and the foliage is well-made. They come pre-potted in sturdy, aesthetically pleasing planters, and the overall appearance is clean and polished.The size is perfect for decorating small spaces, and they\u2019re lightweight, which makes them easy to move around. They hold up well even in areas with a lot of traffic, and I don\u2019t have to worry about them wilting or needing water.My only slight drawback was that one of the topiaries arrived slightly bent, but it was easy to adjust. Overall, I\u2019m happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to add a bit of greenery to their space without the upkeep of real plants!","purchase_model":"Size: 20 inch   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-04 16:10:10"},{"user":"Linda","content":"Even before winter is over, I start thinking about what spring decorations I want to use for my small front porch area. So I start accumulating items a few weeks before the spring season.I normally buy a few planters full of real flowers, but I thought what can I buy instead. Flowers can be expensive and they only last one season. I have to go through the whole process again the next year.I happen to see a video online of a young lady who decided to forgo flowers and buy artificial plants instead.I have never bought artificial flowers or plants for outside. I am not a big fan. They usually look cheap. But when I saw how the plants looked, I decided to do the same.She opted for plants rather than flowers which gave me the idea that maybe small topiaries would be ok. I wouldn't have to water them, dead head them or add more soil.I immediately went to Amazon to check out their selection. I wanted small boxwoods, and I found exactly what I was looking for.The topiaries were perfect. I was afraid they would look cheap, but when I opened them, I was pleasantly surprised. The topiaries were firmly embedded in the small pots, and the stones around the bottom were glued or cemented in. You can easily pick up the plants by the stem and easily move then around.Included are a few extra leaves that just snap in place if you lose any. Also enclosed are 4 small butterflies that just clip on to the leaves.The topiaries are quite full and no holes to see through. You just have to shape them for eveness which is very easy to do. No fuss and no mess!I opted for a tulip theme, so I bought the tulip garden flags on Amazon. The close up picture of the miniature silk tulips are in a planter that I also bought on Amazon, as well as the boxwood mat that the flowers are inserted into. The little sticks with the white wooden tulips are also an Amazon product. They are actually decorative cocktail sticks used for hors d'oeuvre or to hold sandwiches together.They were so cute and they fit right in with my tulip theme.So thanks to Amazon, my spring porch design came alive and I couldn't be happier.","purchase_model":"Size: 24 inch   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-04-17 16:10:10"},{"user":"Cuffey's Cakes","content":"People that complain didn't take the time to put the halves together.Its a great product and sturdy.I will add something so they sit up a little higher and look more realistic.I hope they don't fade in the sun.","purchase_model":"Size: 16 inch   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-08 16:10:10"},{"user":"KLR","content":"I bought these for planters on my front porch.

No fading, nothing. I have the large ones, and I bought them initially to replace two round live ones at the base of the front landscape leading up to the stairs up to the porch where the entrance is (where they ended up). The two live ones I was planning on replacing these with had succumbed to that boxwood disease that has been plaguing our area, and I was devistated - as boxwoods are a perfect option for four seasons; they stay green year round. Well, I bought another two of the same size and they did replace the live ones once I saw the quality. I will add a picture soon, but at the moment, I\u2019m adding some fall branches to the top two and I\u2019d like you to get the whole picture. I am shocked at how great these are for faux bushes!
