			var commentsList = [{"user":"Customer Review","content":"Though I dearly would love to have a live fiddle leaf fig tree, my rental situation doesn't provide a good life for plants of this size and def not woody tree plants.The photos of this product are pretty good, but don't really do the plant justice. In person, it's gorgeous, the details are very well executed. I'm very pleased with the inviting warmth that this tree has brought into my space filing a previously boring corner.It took less than 10 minutes to fan the leaves out to a very pleasing display after removing from the box. I haven't found the decorative pot that I want to use with it yet, but it's very steady on its feet with the small weighted bottom in which it's mounted.This is a very nice quality artificial that will stand up in high traffic areas in an office, salon, or boutique. I'm looking forward to some extended travel next year and only recently realized that I won't have to make special accommodation for this gorgeous plant to still be beautiful when I return.I think this is a good value and appreciate that the vendor dispatched my order request right away.","purchase_model":"Size: 5ft Color: Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-14 16:10:11"},{"user":"B","content":"I was wanting some reddish and differently colored plants to the point I was going to color some of my faux plants, so this was an instant order and I love it so much!It looks realistic and I didn't have to assemble it either, win x3!It is cute on it's own in its petite black pot in my decor but would also be beautiful lofted in a larger pot.Brings a beautiful vibe and a bit more of that fashionable 70's feel with the warmer tones.So cute!!","purchase_model":"Size: 3ft Color: Fall Tree  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-29 16:10:11"},{"user":"gadgetlady","content":"This item is really lifelike.Oh sure, take a very close look and you'll see that it's not a real plant, but most folks don't do that.They walk into or through a room, notice the fern, THINK it's a fern, and that's that.I put it together and it has that effect on ME.It came very well packaged, with zero damage.The parts all had matching stickers.Took about five minutes to assemble.I spent a few more minutes just kind of bending branches out to make it look more full.And once in place it did not disappoint.","purchase_model":"Size: 5ft Color: Areca Palm  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-08 16:10:11"},{"user":"Celeste","content":"I got the 5 foot tall Birds of Paradise and she is stunning, very lifelike in my opinion. When fully fluffed out, it looks just like the photo. Size is true to description, she's a big girl. It came in a pot but I'm going to put it into one that's more elegant and display it in the corner of my study. It's crazy how it transformed my study instantly. I love plants and greenery but I'm not blessed with a green thumb (or much sunlight in that room) so I stick to faux plants, and I'm so happy I found this one! Highly recommend.","purchase_model":"Size: 5ft Color: Bird of Paradise  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-06 16:10:11"},{"user":"turtlex","content":"Product - Size: 5FT | Color: Areca Palm | Number of Items: 1This is a great artificial tree.We have an odd sort of corner in a guest bedroom and we needed something to bring some design-like feature to the room. We found this tree and are very pleased with it.Assembly is super easy and the branches can be carefully moved.The tree looks real to me and it looks great in the room.I do wish the base were a little heavier, but since this is displayed against a wall there's no chance it will be knocked over.","purchase_model":"Size: 5ft Color: Areca Palm  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-11 16:10:11"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"This is a really nice addition to my set of faux indoor plants. Real or fake plants just change the atmosphere and vibe of a room. This is really nice. It's easy to assemble with numbered stickers stating, which leaf goes to, which stem on the base. They are very easy to shape for what you want it to look like. It's very realistic looking and the leaves are very nice quality. The base is nice and heavy and keeps this thing standing upright. I'm satisfied with this and it is a good value for what you get.","purchase_model":"Size: 5ft Color: Bird of Paradise  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-08 16:10:11"},{"user":"willg","content":"This artificial tree from Ecoopts is very lifelike. The coloration is excellent and there is no assembly required. Just take out of the box and arrange the leaves. It is so lifelike that my iPhone identified it as a Garden Croton. A very attractive plant that adds a nice shot of color to a room., Nice!!!","purchase_model":"Size: 3ft Color: Fall Tree  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-08 16:10:11"}];
