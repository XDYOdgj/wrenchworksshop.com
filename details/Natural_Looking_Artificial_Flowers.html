I bought a round piece of styrofoam to insert in the pot first then stuck each stem in the styrofoam to keep them in place. The porch does not get direct sun so hoping the color of the flowers lasts. I am not fond of artificial plants but no one sees them up close so think this may work. So far so good! I bought the purple and pink flowers and both bunches filled the pot perfectly. Being inserted into the styrofoam will make it easy to remove and turn upside down to spray off if they get dirty.",

I used two orders to fill this large pot, and they are very realistic.The color is bright, and they can be easily changed, moved, and rinsed off after a season of use. I have not witnessed any fading, and my only negative is that the petals are a shiny plastic, so not as matte as real mums.","purchase_model":"Color: Yellow Color: Yellow  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-16 16:10:11"},{"user":"Karol","content":"They look like real plants, I love it!","purchase_model":"Color: Green Orange Color: Green Orange  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-31 16:10:11"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"These flowers are so realistic!!

These look great. I used a 12 piece per basket. Make sure you follow tiny font instructions where you spread out and dip each piece in swirled in hot water which I put in a bucket for 20 seconds - look so much better and realistic. I also did hot water method on other faux flowers that had no instructions. Out of the 3 different orders, these were by far the best looking ones.","purchase_model":"Color: Magenta Color: Magenta  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-09 16:10:11"},{"user":"Nancy Pittman","content":"They look amazing!

I bought a round piece of styrofoam to insert in the pot first then stuck each stem in the styrofoam to keep them in place. The porch does not get direct sun so hoping the color of the flowers lasts. I am not fond of artificial plants but no one sees them up close so think this may work. So far so good! I bought the purple and pink flowers and both bunches filled the pot perfectly. Being inserted into the styrofoam will make it easy to remove and turn upside down to spray off if they get dirty.","purchase_model":"Color: Purple Color: Purple  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-30 16:10:11"}];
