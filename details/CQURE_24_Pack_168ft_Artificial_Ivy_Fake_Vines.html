I got another to cover the other half of my bed. It is perfect, and I added a touch of fairy lights. Leaves seem great after detangling the vines! Functionality worked for the purpose! The plastic is okay. It almost feels like a forest earth vibe to my bedroom. Touch on the fairy lights, and you are in a cool colored mood trance. I\u2019d say if you are iffy, look at the reviews. I personally say get it if you love earthy decor. I just sprayed some febreeze and it it okay. I turned on my fan for the most part. But I was not nauseated from the smell. Think of new plastic or hospital plastic smell. That kind of an odor. It is a perfect touch to my bedroom and I cannot wait to hang the second half of my wall!","purchase_model":"Length Range: 168Ft   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-07 16:10:09"},{"user":"Damon","content":"I am the most unreliable person in the entire world to hang things on walls. Putting these up was so easy. They give you so many strands of these and the length is good. Color is a darker green. The smell kind of weird but it wears off. When you open the package there will be tiny green flakes that will explode on you so don\u2019t open it over your wedding dress or a carpet or something, it\u2019s like glitter. There\u2019s so much for such a cheap price. Whoever made these, I\u2019m going to kiss you on the mouth. These fake plant strings brought together community, languages, cultures. There\u2019s no difference in politics when you open these up. Your cat will not be allergic and die. When you buy these, there will never be any more war or inflation. These are life savers. I love whoever made this. I didn\u2019t even finish setting them all up because I had to write a review. Anyways, get these ones. They\u2019re perfect.","purchase_model":"Length Range: 168Ft   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-04 16:10:09"},{"user":"deanna","content":"There is a slight smell when you pull it out of the package however it goes away almost immediately.

And yes they do have some fibers that shaking off before pulling apart will get rid of a lot of them. They were packaged really well which made it easy to pull them apart. Overall very happy with these.","purchase_model":"Length Range: 168Ft   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-29 16:10:09"},{"user":"tntricia","content":"I bought 2 brands.I am buying this brand again.Came in a box twisted tied together.Easy to pull apart and work with.Handles being tied in a knot and threaded through the trellis.Have already had 2 people ask how I got fully vine plants so fast so until close it is difficult to tell.I feel certain they will fade quickly in the Texas sun, but they are temporary until I get plants going.It is being used to shade the corner of the house from the afternoon sun hopefully cooling the room down a bit.Morning glories and sweet potato vines will take over the job next year.It it works at all I will keep these handy for anytime the plants are not covering.I did not mind the smell.It reminded me of the plastic animal shapes you get atthe zoo that you \"mold\" yourself.The other brand was far stronger and harder on the nose.Otherwise they looked identical.So I am going with this brand again because it's nit so tough on the nose.Absolutely thrilled.","purchase_model":"Length Range: 168Ft   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-04 16:10:09"},{"user":"Jennifer","content":"I use these strands all over my house, inside and out.

I personally don\u2019t smell the smell the other reviews are talking about. They do leave little strands of green when you start pulling them apart so don\u2019t start pulling them apart on your bed like I did lol we used a staple gun and it worked well","purchase_model":"Length Range: 168Ft   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-24 16:10:09"}];
