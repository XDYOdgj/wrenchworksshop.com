			var commentsList = [{"user":"DIY senior","content":"After examining the quality and prices of branches in Hobby Lobby, I went for these hoping I would get the same quality at a lesser price.I do a lot of floral arrangements and am very fussy about quality and price. Many of the branches sold by other Amazon vendors came in a group of 3, whereas these were 5 at the same/similar price point.Well I was more than elated with my order and may be ordering more to fill the intended vessel.The leaves and branches look real; the color is as good as anything found in nature and they are easy to work with in order to achieve the desired arrangement.I may decide to either make a few branches shorter but so far I like the cluster as it is now.They came tied together and rolled into a large circle inside a plastic bag.Item was quickly shipped and delivered... packaging did not alter or damage these during shipment and it's an easy task to unbend and arrange each branch to its desired position. Very pleasedcustomer!!!Update:As thought, I did order another cluster of 5 but have to wait for deliver since inventory had to be replenished.But it is worth the wait.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 5   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-02-01 16:10:09"},{"user":"David Aldaco","content":"Purchased these stems multiple times have them through out my home and they look realistic.

I used 4 in the larger vase on my kitchen island and put one stem in a smaller vase on the mantle. The leaves are a \"cloth\" material and, IMO the plastic brown stems make for a realistic look.Very pleased with the value and the overall beautiful minimalist presentation they make which is exactly what I wanted for Spring.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 5   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-03-17 16:10:09"},{"user":"Charlie Pollack","content":"Fabulous product to add to my vase!

With this product, you get what you pay for.I hope this helps.","purchase_model":"Item Package Quantity: 4   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2022-12-16 16:10:09"},{"user":"Nina","content":"Love it.

I was pleasantly surprised.I needed something that can 'live' year round in desert weather, and these work well.They are flexible, which was so helpful when arranging.
