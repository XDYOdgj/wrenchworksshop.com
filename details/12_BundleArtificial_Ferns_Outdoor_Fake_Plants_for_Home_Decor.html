Off you get close enough it becomes obvious they are fake, but very convincing from a distance. Not glossy or off color and blatantly fake. They do start to fade rather quickly outside though. Best kept inside. They are not hard to the touch and you don\u2019t have to worry about getting cut or jagged.","purchase_model":"Color: Nandina Set Color: Nandina Set  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-05-05 16:10:09"},{"user":"Mel P.","content":"\r\nThe media could not be loaded.\r\n","purchase_model":"Color: Nandina Set Color: Nandina Set  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-03-31 16:10:09"},{"user":"Carol D.","content":"You get 10 kinds of artificial greenery.I initially got it to use as fillers in other plants, but once I saw how well it looked all together as one plant, I decided to go with that design.Some of these pieces I have never seen before, so I was impressed the way everything went together so nicely.The plants are made of plastic so they are very strong and will last forever.I love that you can use this inside or outside because the plants are fade resistant so they will maintain their beauty for years to come.I haven't decided whether to use them inside or outside yet.Inside the greenery just adds a beautiful touch to your room.Outside they are beautiful as well and will enhance you garden.My outside garden is all artificial plants so I don't have to maintain them and they won't shrivel up and die on me.These greens are a great addition to your artificial flower supplies.Recommended.","purchase_model":"Color: Nandina Set Color: Nandina Set  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-12-30 16:10:09"},{"user":"F.Z.","content":"The alyptus Faux Plants Outdoor 14 in 1 Set is a great choice for outdoor d\u00e9cor lovers who don't want to deal with real plants. It has 14 fake plants that look real and colorful. They are made of strong and sun-proof plastic. You can put them anywhere you like, such as your flower bed, garden, pot, window box, or farmhouse. They have different shapes and sizes, like nandina, boxwood, grass, and fern. You can combine them in any way you want.The only problem is that they might lose color if they get too much sun. But you can fix that by changing their place or putting them in the shade sometimes. Also, some of the plants might be stiff or flat when you get them, but you can make them look better by bending and shaping them.In short, the alyptus Faux Plants Outdoor 14 in 1 Set is a wonderful product for outdoor d\u00e9cor fans who hate real plants. They are cheap, realistic, and flexible. They can make any space cozy and welcoming.
