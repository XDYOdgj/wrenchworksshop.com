My wife has these Boxwood Artificial Plants outdoors, in several planters. She enjoys moving them to other areas, which is easily done since they are not heavy to carry as those with potting soil, etc. She uses floral foam balls that fit whatever size container she is using, and then Spanish moss over that once she has inserted all the stems. It's a nice look, they're sturdy, stand a little over 14 inches high, and they're affordable as well.",

The lavender is a great size and is easy to fluff out. I really love that the lavender is plastic, and still realistic looking. These faux lavender creates a large bunch when fluffed and bunched all together. There is one photo in which I am holding all 10 stems of lavender (for size reference). I did not fluff all the lavender out in this photo, so it would be even larger if I did.I ordered this lavender as I wanted to use it in a pot of faux flowers.I am not great at keeping real flowers alive in a pot in the summer as I forget to water them.Life gets busy - I'm sure some of you can relate.I always plant real flowers around my yard (and will continue to do so) and those plants always survive fine, but when I plant flowers in pots, I forget to water them and they usually die.Spring has finally arrived (I hope) and I decided to try out some faux flowers in one of my outdoor pots.I added some solar flowers in my planter along with lots of other flowers and this lavender that I ordered.The last photo is the large planter that I filled with faux flowers.It's kind of hard to see the lavender in that photo, as the photo is taken in the dark, but the lavender looks beautiful mixed in with all the other flowers.I am so happy that there is 10 sprigs of lavender in the order as I have plenty to do another pot of flowers.I am very happy with this bunch of lavender and recommend it to anyone.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-03-31 16:10:11"},{"user":"Anthony Northrup","content":"We use many artificial plant decor as well as natural grown ones. The artificial are so easy to care for, so that's definitely an advantage. My wife has these Boxwood Artificial Plants outdoors, in several planters. She enjoys moving them to other areas, which is easily done since they are not heavy to carry as those with potting soil, etc. She uses floral foam balls that fit whatever size container she is using, and then Spanish moss over that once she has inserted all the stems. It's a nice look, they're sturdy, stand a little over 14 inches high, and they're affordable as well.","purchase_model":"Size: 10 Color: Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-09 16:10:11"}];
