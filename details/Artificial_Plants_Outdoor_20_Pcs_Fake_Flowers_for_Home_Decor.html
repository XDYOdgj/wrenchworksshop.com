The artificial lavender is very beautiful. The generous bundle includes 16 pieces. They are durable and easily shaped. I grouped the majority of them together in one pot which produced a lovely, bountiful arrangement. Then I took some of the lavender flowers and mixed them in with another floral arrangement. The floral arrangement was already nice, but the lavender added a whole new level of beauty to the arrangement. I\u2019m enjoying these inside for right now. As soon as the weather gets a little warmer, I will place these outside. I\u2019m loving that I don\u2019t have to water the lavender or give it any additional care. That\u2019s my kind of plant.

At at 13.8 inches long, these stems should work well although I may have to use a hot glue gun for placement.These arrived tightly wrapped in plastic wrap but they seem to have flexibility for shaping. They have theappearance of real lavender flowers but more lush than anything I've ever been able to grow, lol. Adding these bunches will add a pop of color that I'll be able to see when my verticals are drawn and I love the purple color. I'm hoping they truly are UV resistant so that they maintain some color vibrancy over time. I plan to 'plant' them at the beginning of March when our rainy season is over. I'll add a photo after but wanted to let other potential buyers who may be on the fence that these are nice artificial flowers at a good price.","purchase_model":"Size: 16pcs Color: Purple  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-02 16:10:11"},{"user":"Mooshi's mom","content":"This review is for the Thinktral Artificial16 piece artificial UV protected plants. Lavender plants perhaps?This is the year where I work smarter and not harder...I am incorporating a lot of artificial flowers into my patio and flower beds this year to ease up on the cost and the time involved, and constant maintenance of planting real ones.Upon opening them up, you should slide and space and rotate the leaves up to towards the flower to make them look more real and also will help hide the center wire of the flower.I personally like the leaf to go beyond the head of the flower, as if found in nature.They are all 100% plastic, and they are bright, and I hope do not fade, so in the fall, I can pick up, rinse off and use next season, or replace with a fall color since I live in FL.The leaves are a brighter green at the tips then the center, and remind me of the color leaves get after a nice rain. in the morning sunshine. These will look fabulous among my other live plants to boost the color and hide empty spaces in my flower bed and borders.Once I get that done, I will update photos, but for now are in a vase waiting on the weather to get out and tackle that next project.","purchase_model":"Size: 16pcs Color: Purple  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-08 16:10:11"},{"user":"Reviewer","content":"So Pretty!

Anyway, I have some live Iris in the front yard that are grandfathered in, and I'd love to have some other purples to go with them, and these are going to be the perfect compliment when the Iris bloom. I've put them into a little tin bucket and they look adorable there. The flowers are a thick plasticky materials that looks really nice and is very robust. I can tell these are going to hold up nicely. They also have a lot of green with them, which adds to the realism and makes the whole thing just more charming.
